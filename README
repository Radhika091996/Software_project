Running Using Jar:
    java -cp <WordAnalysisProject_PATH> Main "Test String"
    Note : Executable jar file is located under target directory.
    example:
    java -cp WordAnalysisProject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Main "This is Test String to Test the program"
    Sample output:
    Running word freq count with input : This is Test String to Test the program
    {the=1, Test=2, This=1, is=1, String=1, to=1, program=1}

If you don't provide input, the program takes default test string.

    java -cp WordAnalysisProject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Main
    Output:
    Running word freq count with input : apple banana apple orange /
    {banana=1, orange=1, apple=2, /=1}
